# AVLtrees
A simple C++ program that was made to test if an input is a valid AVL tree or not. This program displays fundamental knowledge of C++ as well as a glimpse into one of the many, and more interesting, data structures I've learned about. In order to run, open the project in your chosen development environment that supports C++ and simply run Main.cpp.
